## Version Info
This configuration script was last updated for latest software versions on 6/6/2019. It has been tested on Lubuntu 19.04 Disco Dingo (x64).

This script may function for newer versions of Lubuntu, but it is recommended that you use the intended version unless you are an experienced Linux user.

## Instructions
1. Download [Lubuntu 19.04 x64](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/19.04/release/lubuntu-19.04-desktop-amd64.iso) (or the latest version if you are an experienced Linux user and are willing to modify the script as needed for compatibility).
2. Perform a full install from the Lubuntu .iso file on the target computer. Be sure to set up an account with password to act as your root (administrator) account.
3. Open a terminal (CTL+ALT+T) and clone this repository by typing: git clone https://github.com/TSoGiants/Lubuntu-Workstation-Config.git
4. Run the bash script by typing: sudo ./Lubuntu-Workstation-Config/init.sh
4. The script will run for quite a while. The only prompt will be at the end when you must enter a password and (optionally) a name for the student user.
